# Verilog RTL Practice Repository

This repository contains structured Verilog RTL modules implemented as part of my ongoing practice and refinement of digital design fundamentals and coding styles.

The focus is on strengthening core concepts such as sequential logic, combinational logic, FSM design, synchronization, and memory modeling, while following clean and synthesizable RTL coding practices.

## Implemented Modules

- **2-FF Synchronizer**  
  Metastability mitigation technique for safe clock domain crossing.

- **Clock Divider**  
  Parameterizable clock division logic.

- **Mealy FSM**  
  Finite State Machine where output depends on state and input.

- **Moore FSM**  
  Finite State Machine where output depends only on state.

- **Multiplexer (MUX)**  
  Combinational selection logic implementation.

- **Priority Encoder**  
  Encodes highest-priority active input.

- **RAM (RTL Model)**  
  Synchronous memory implementation in Verilog.

- **RAM Testbench**  
  Functional verification of RAM behavior using simulation.

- **SIPO (Serial-In Parallel-Out)**  
  Shift register design.

- **Synchronous Counter**  
  Sequential counter implementation.
